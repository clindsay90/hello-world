# hello-world
My first repository
I'm an unemployed 26yo with a masters degree, trying to find my place in a brutal and often confusing job market. I would like not to think about my present ciucmstances, but that's a challenge especially when you lack the very thing you need to achieve the basic necessities of life that keep you going, which are often taken granted. I'm hoping to turn things around as soon as possible, so I figure I might as well challenge myself by learning a new set of skills. The task is daunting, but I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
