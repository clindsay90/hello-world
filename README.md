# hello-world
My first repository
I'm an unemployed 26yo with a masters degree, trying to find my place in a brutal and often confusing job-market. I would like tp not think about my unfortunate ciucmstances, but it's a challenge when you don't have what you need to achieve the basic necessities of ife that keep you going. I'm hoping to turn things around as soon as possible, so I figure I might as well challenge myself by learning a new set of skills. The task is daunting, but I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
